# Coffee Machine from Hyperskill

This project is created to help those beginners who chose the "Coffee machine" project for themselves and want to understand the logic of the code for the project  
Idea and tasks for this project I took [here](https://hyperskill.org/study-plan).

### Attention!

The logic of the code is slightly added and improved by me, in order to improve the work of the project.
For each described method or class, I wrote whether this method is important for the successful completion of the project or not.  

## Code explanation

This repo includes only files that fulfill the condition of the task, I decided not to add any Gradle files or tests written by the Hyperskill team.    
All explanation of this code provided in the code comments for each function and each class.

## Ending

As for me, there is no point in adding more code, but if you want - you have every right to do so, if you find bugs - let me know, I will be happy to fix everything
